# Introduction

Motivation
Explanation of dataset

# GAN Model

Theory behind the model

# Version 1

Original, based on pytorch DCGAN

# Modification 1

Label smoothing + activation function change

# Modification 2

Label smoothing only

# Setbacks

Spiking - mode collapse, GAN is hard to train
Unstructured data - harder for model to learn the structure (but got the style)

# Conclusion

What would do if more time
