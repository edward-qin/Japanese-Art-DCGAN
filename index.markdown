# Introduction

Our goal for this project was to generate new visual art in the style of Japansese art from Japan from the Muromachi period (1392-1573) all the way to the Sh≈çwa period (1926-1989). We used a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which is composed of a generative and discriminative network. The dataset we used is the Japanese Art directory from the [WikiArt Art Movements/Styles](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sivarazadi/wikiart-art-movementsstyles) dataset on Kaggle. 

# GAN Model

Theory behind the model

# Version 1

Original, based on pytorch DCGAN

# Modification 1

Label smoothing + activation function change

# Modification 2

Label smoothing only

# Setbacks

Spiking - mode collapse, GAN is hard to train
Unstructured data - harder for model to learn the structure (but got the style)

# Conclusion

What would do if more time
If we successfully train this model, we can expand it to also generate different styles from the same dataset on Kaggle.
